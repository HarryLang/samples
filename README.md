This repo contains some of my code samples.

-----(1)-----
The directory "clustering" contains my parallel programming final assignment where I implemented a k-means clustering algorithm
in MPI which can be run on a cluster.  A Linux shell script generates sample data.

-----(2)-----
The directory "MapReduce" contains a submission for a parallel programming assignment where we had to use Hadoop to find
mutual friends (i.e. "friends of friends") in an undirected graph.

-----(3)-----
The file "triangle.java" is a solution to a coding challenge which computes the maximum sum along any path in a triangle.
For example, an input triangle may be:
1
8 2
1 1 8
Whose maximum path would be 8+2+1=11.
