Instructions:
This program will take weighted vectors in Euclidean space and cluster them (the output is the set of k centroids).

----------------------------

Before clustering data, we need data.  The following shell script will take care of this.

Run:
./buildData.sh -f 4

----------------------------

Now we can compile the program.

Run:
mpicc -std=c99 kMeansPlusPlus.c -o cluster

----------------------------

Run the program.

Run:
mpirun -np 5 cluster 5

The command line argument of 5 signifies k (i.e. to use 5 clusters).

The optimal centers are approximately* at (-500, 0, 0), (-250, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0), (250, 0, 0), (500, 0, 0)
* only approximately, since the data is randomly generated

Example output: (note that centroids do not come in any particular order)
  Centroid 1 x-value: -0.195217 y = -0.302741 z = -0.803969
  Centroid 2 x-value: 500.013184 y = -0.822536 z = -0.449899
  Centroid 3 x-value: -500.936920 y = -0.419298 z = -0.314180
  Centroid 4 x-value: -250.971481 y = -0.521424 z = -0.591360
  Centroid 5 x-value: 250.029480 y = -0.594582 z = -0.384687
  Runtime: 110822 microseconds

----------------------------

If you would like to get average runtimes for various values of k and P, I have written a script.

Run:
./clusterTester.sh

This runs a total of hundreds of trials and will take several minutes to complete.
